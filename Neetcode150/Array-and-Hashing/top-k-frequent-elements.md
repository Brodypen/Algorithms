# Top K Frequent Elements
```ad-tldr
title: Summary
collapse: closed
- Use a counter/hashMap and a freq array (bucket sort)
- Count the frequency of elements
	- { 1 : 3, 2 : 2, 3 : 1}
- Put key value pair into freq (freq is index by value)
	- Freq table is index by count OF elements, so therefore it should be freq[v].append(key)
- Loop reverse and append it to result array, once res array is equal to k, return res.
```
## How to solve


Key notes:
Know to make unique arrays in array, you have to do [[] for i in range(len(nums) + 1)]. 
If you don't, you are making copies of the array. 
	That means when u change a val in one array, in changes vals in all. (Because it is only one array)

### Solution
```ad-tldr
title: Solution
collapse: closed

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        count = {}
        freq = [[] for i in range(len(nums) + 1)] # Important

        for n in nums:
            count[n] = 1 + count.get(n, 0)
        for n, c in count.items():
            freq[c].append(n)
        
        res = []
        for i in range(len(nums), 0, -1):
            for n in freq[i]:
                res.append(n)
                if len(res) == k:
                    return res
```
