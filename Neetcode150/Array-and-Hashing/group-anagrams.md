# Review notes
## 10/01/2023
- Remember to counter[ord(char) - ord('a')]
	- Return .values()
Feel pretty confident again of this problem, easy to remember and solve. Did this in about 5 minutes!!
## 09/28/2023
Great review! Leetcode was easy. I feel like I have a deep understand of the question.
Next time, do it without reading anything, I felt I got it because I read one line.
# Group Anagrams
```ad-tldr
title: Summary
collapse: closed
- Create hashMap of list
- Loop through array, to count every anagram ord(character)-ord('a') and put into counter array.
	- Append tuple(counterArray) into hashMap.defaultdict(list)
- Return hashMap.values()
```
## How to solve

This problem is solved by:
Using a hashmap, with a key : value where the key is the anagram value and value is the the array of anagrams.
The key as the anagram value is an array counter of letters, we have to use a tuple to put in array into the hashMap. tuple(count)

For example:
["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Key : value
[0,1]... : ['bat']
... : ["nat","tan"]
... : ["ate","eat","tea"]

Key notes:
Remember to ord(c) - ord('a') for number index of char
Remember to wrap the array as a tuple to put into a hashMap
Return hashMap.values()

### Solution
```ad-tldr
title: Solution
collapse: closed

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # What are possible solution?
        # So to find an anagram, we can use a hashmap.
        # If they have the same, we can put them into the same list.
        # # Hashmap
        # # key: value
        # # wordCounter: [word array]
        hashMap = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c)-ord('a')] += 1
            hashMap[tuple(count)].append(s)

        return hashMap.values()
        # What to learn?
        # ord is important.
        # tuple is interesting, since we want to hash a list, have to make it a tuple
        

```
