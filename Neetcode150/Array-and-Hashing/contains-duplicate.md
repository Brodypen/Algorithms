title: Solution
collapse: closed
```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        hashSet = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num in hashSet:
                return True
            hashSet.add(num)

##### Cue Flashcards ðŸ—ƒ
- How many pairs of elements are there, what is the brute force time?
	- n^2 amount of pairs, therefore O(n^2) brute force time complexity to just compare.
- What data structure can we use to lower this time?
	- A hashSet. This makes the time complexity O(n) with space of O(n)
