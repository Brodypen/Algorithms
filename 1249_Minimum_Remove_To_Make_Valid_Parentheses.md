## Problem statement
First thing I think of when parentheses is stack. 
Can't recall how to do. Please review.

After review:
Basically go from left to right, copying letter and left parthenses, but keep track of them with a count. If you see a right parthenses, see if count > 0, then add it.
After loop right to left as long as count != 0, remove left parentheses.
Next time: Do arrays instead of string concat.


### Solution (Optimized)
```python
class Solution:

```
