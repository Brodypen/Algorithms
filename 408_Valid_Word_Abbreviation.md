# Problem name

title: Psuedo Solution

## Problem statement
Basically I actually understand this problem, two pointers, checking if characters are equal if not return false.
If you get a number (have to have case where it is 0 first), while loop to get the full number, move word ptr by that number.

If at the end both ptr return the end of the list, then its it true.

Try again to code without help

### Solution (Optimized)
```python
class Solution:

```
