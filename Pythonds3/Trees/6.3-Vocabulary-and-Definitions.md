Node - main part, key value pair
Edge - connects two nodes, can only have one incoming edge (one parent if not the root) and multiple outgoing edges (multiple children)
Leaf node - node with no children

- If each node in the tree has a maximum of two children, we say that the tree is aÂ **binary tree**.
- - A unique path traverses from the root to each node.
