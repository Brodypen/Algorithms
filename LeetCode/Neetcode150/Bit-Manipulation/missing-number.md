### Solution
```ad-tldr
title: Solution
collapse: closed

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # XOR method,
        # same numbers cancel eachother out. ex: 5^5 = 0.
        # Therefore, since there is one number, we can use XOR to find that number.
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(nums) + 1):
            res ^= i
        for num in nums:
            res ^= num
        return res
