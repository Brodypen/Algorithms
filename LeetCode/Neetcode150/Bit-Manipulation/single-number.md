collapse: closed

```python
class Solution:
    # Solution, by using XOR, you can 'subtract' the other pair.
    # 2 = 10, 2 XOR 2 = 00. Does not matter what order you do it as.
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for n in nums:
            res ^= n
        return res

```
