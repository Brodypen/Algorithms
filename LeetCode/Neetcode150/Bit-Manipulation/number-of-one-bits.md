Count number of set bits.

### Solution
```ad-tldr
title: Solution
collapse: closed

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Brute force: O(n)
        # This solution checks the LSB (right most bit), if 1, increment count.
        # Then rightshift, while n.

        # Optimal solution: O(L) (L => Count of bits that are one)
        # We use n= n&(n-1), this will repeat = to amount of count of bits that are one.
        
        count = 0
        while n:
            n &=(n-1)
            count += 1

        return count
        

```
